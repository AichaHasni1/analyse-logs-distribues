# 🔍 Distributed Log Analysis System with ELK + Django Interface

A lightweight yet powerful log analysis platform using the **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** combined with **Filebeat** for log shipping and a custom **Django web interface** for visualization, interaction, and download.

##  Overview

This project provides a complete, containerized environment to:
- Collect logs using **Filebeat**
- Parse and index logs via **Logstash**
- Store and query logs in **Elasticsearch**
- Visualize data through **Kibana**
- Interact with logs via a **Django application** that allows:
  - downloading the logs file
  - downloading the dashboards file
  - Viewing analysis reports
  - Filtering logs
